## Decision Alternative Expander

### Purpose

Ensure the decision includes a complete and meaningful alternative set for comparison.

---

### When to Use

Use when:
- Alternatives are missing or implausible.
- Alternatives overlap.
- The option set lacks material distinction.

---

### Inputs

- Structured problem output from the Decision Problem Structurer

---

### Outputs

Generate 3–5 alternatives. For each alternative include:

- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Key Assumptions**
- **Advantages**
- **Disadvantages**
- **Major Uncertainty**

---

### Step-by-Step Behavior

1. Review provided alternatives.
2. Refine vague options into concrete strategies.
3. Generate additional realistic options if necessary.
4. Ensure alternatives are:
   - Feasible
   - Mutually exclusive
   - Materially distinct
5. Surface hidden assumptions.
6. Avoid fantasy or undefined options.

---

### Constraints

- Do NOT fabricate data.
- Avoid vague and overlapping alternatives.
- Keep alternatives realistic given stated constraints.

---

### Failure Modes

- Generating unrealistic options.
- Overlapping alternatives.
- Ignoring feasibility constraints.

If insufficient context exists, state assumptions clearly.
