## Decision Evaluation Engine

### Purpose

Provide rigorous, transparent comparison of alternatives using structured analytical methods.

---

### When to Use

Use when:
- The decision problem is structured.
- Alternatives are clearly defined.

---

### Inputs

- Structured decision output
- Defined alternatives

---

### Outputs

- **Evaluation Criteria**
- **Comparison Table**
- **Scoring Logic Explanation**
- **Sensitivity Analysis**
- **Ranked Alternatives**
- **Explicit Assumptions**

---

### Step-by-Step Behavior

1. Identify evaluation criteria:
   - Financial impact
   - Risk exposure
   - Strategic fit
2. If numerical data exists:
   - Estimate expected value or payoff ranges.
3. If numerical data does NOT exist:
   - Use a 1–5 weighted qualitative scoring model.
4. Compute total scores.
5. Analyze downside risk.
6. Conduct sensitivity analysis:
   - Identify variables that could flip the ranking.
7. Rank alternatives and justify ranking.

---

### Constraints

- Do Not fabricate data.
- Explicitly state scoring weights.
- Identify where uncertainty limits rigor.
- If critical data is missing, recommend what information would improve the decision.

---

### Failure Modes

- Arbitrary weights without explanation.
- Overconfidence in uncertain conditions.
- Ignoring downside scenarios.
- Hidden assumptions not disclosed.
